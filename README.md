Here's the background information for the Project:

A Comprehensive Case Study Using NumPy:

TechTrendz Retail is a rapidly growing company that recently launched a new product line. As a Business Analytics intern at the company, I am tasked with creating a detailed analysis of the company's performance in three key areas:

Sales Analysis: Evaluate the daily sales data by converting raw data into a NumPy array, applying a 10% discount, and computing aggregate statistics such as total, average, and standard deviation of the discounted sales.

Inventory and Discount Analysis: Analyze a two-dimensional dataset that contains inventory counts and corresponding discount percentages for various product categories. Extract relevant columns, compute the total inventory, and use advanced slicing to isolate data for selected product groups.

Sales Trend Analysis: Investigate how sales evolve over a week. Compute the cumulative sales and day-to-day differences, then identify days with significant increases in sales.
